# Sean Pulver Senior Research
 Sean Pulver's Senior Research Project

The purpose of my senior research project is to create a game and then apply a neural network artificial intelligence to play the game, learn the game, and then get really good at the game. Ultimately the goal is to create an artificial intelligence that is better than the game than I am.
