# Sean Pulver Senior Research
 Sean Pulver's Senior Research Project

The Purpose of my Research Project is to take a NEAT Flappy Bird Program and then alter the innate variables to test what are the most challenging variables.
The Flappy bird NEAT program comes from TechwithTim's github page which is linked here : https://github.com/techwithtim/NEAT-Flappy-Bird
